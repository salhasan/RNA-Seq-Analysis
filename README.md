# RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis
- Utilized publicly available RNA-Seq data from GTEx via recount2 to perform a differential expression analysis on potential gene therapy for sickle cell disease
- Found significant differences of expression between the groups, including several off-target genes
- The data set consists of 16 samples where all are of cell line HUDEP2 (Human Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Erythroid Progenitor)
  - 8 samples have wild-type genotype
  - 8 with knockout "ZBTB7A gene
- ZBTB7A gene produces an LRF transcription factor that represses fetal Î²-like globin expression in adult red blood cells.
- The data set was retrieved from https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/ with accession code SRP066151.
