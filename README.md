# RNA-Seq-Analysis

The data set used in this workflow is from an RNA-Seq experiment. There are 16 samples where all are of cell line HUDEP2 (Human Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Erythroid Progenitor). 8 samples have wild-type genotype and 8 with knockout gene "ZBTB7A". ZBTB7A gene produces LRF transcription factor that represses the expression of fetal Î²-like globin in adult red blood cells.
